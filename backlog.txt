There is a probelm when calculating sqrt(x^2) the plto look a bit weird
When calculating tan(x) the plot library doesn't understand sec
Still some problems with the latex parse
ln(x) doesn't work

ln and tan are fixed using the XCalc librairy, now the problem is creating custom log and square function

Solved the tan problem by using both librairies, problem with XCalc is that it has ome weird results from time to time, so we will only use it in the case mathJS doesn't work

Weird stuff happens if you don't put the parenthisis in properly.

It was because I wrote -1(1/3x) instead of -(1/3*x)

In the plto generator I modify the "a " and b value maybe create a way to modify it. 

Problem with the plotter when using fraction powers(sqrt)
graphType: 'polyline' seems to fix it pfiou

Think about implementing a proper parse like nearly
one extra feature is atan(x)

Different results for ln(i):
symbo= \ln \left(i\right)i^x

Modified the Math.js librairy to deal with. So ow we can drop XCalc

Dropping gamma function I think it's innacurate

Problem with abs turning into ab2
same for asec ad all the a family probly


x ^ (-1/3) This doesn't work

Line 43107 created a custom erf function, The problem is that it uses ln and pi which are converted to numbers
