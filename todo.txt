[] Create a parser for ln function
[]refactor the check constants to enable more flexible 
[] Bit of a problem when runing log(8,x) we get 2.0794415416798357 instead of ln(8)
number of constants and custom values
[] Take a look at the extra functions we have eg tanh
[] fix x ^ (-1/3) the result is good not the plot, doesn't show negative values
[ ] In Math.js from line 42963 there we can try to push the equations used to a global variable which we can then display then for the arithmetic part, we can use the soctic extension
[] Check if there will be some errors when parsi ng the complex logs (thought about it when implementing the latex converter)

[] Test d/dx(log(f(x), g(x))) = d/dx(log(f(x)) / log(g(x))) @log line 430000, Just remake all the lo stuff and maybe ln too
[] put the firstParser in an onChange function so to dispay it live

[] refactor operators in order to write it with Javascript (like examples), but maybe it will jiggity so think bout it)
[]Fix show example transition
